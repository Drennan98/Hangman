# Validations 



# Deployment 

- This was my first time using Heroku to deploy a project. **The steps are as follows:**

1. Create a Heroku account. 

2. Create a new app. 

3. Give the app a unique name and select your region from the options. 

4. Connect to GitHub (you may be asked to login).

5. Select which branch you want to deploy from. 

6. Deploy the project. 

- Heroku would be more suitable for backend development which is why it's preferred over GitHub pages for this particular 
project.
