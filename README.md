# Welcome to Hangman! 

This is my 3rd project for the Code Institute Full Stack Software Engineering program. 

You can find the live version of the site here [here](https://hangman0000-3387183dc1ef.herokuapp.com/).

The word bank for the game features words which relate to this course and world of programming> 


# Technologies Ued 

- Python 

- Linter??? (PEP8, Python Checker)


# How to play 

- Hangman is a classic guessing game. 

- The first thing to do is select a difficulty from the options provided.

- Secondly, pick a letter and see does it fit the word in question. 

- You will have six guesses for each difficulty. 

- Each guess must be a single letter. 

- Find out how you did after all your guesses are used up. 

# Features 

- Select from different difficulties (beginner, novice, professional).

- 

# User Stories 

- As a new site user, I would like to play the Hangman game. 

- As a new site user, I like to select different difficulties. 

- As a new site user, I would like to see how many guesses I have left. 


# Key Project Goals 

- I want to make a Hangman Python program which also incorporates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

- I want the program to be user friendly and easy to understand. 


# Validations 



# Deployment 

- This was my first time using Heroku to deploy a project. **The steps are as follows:**

1. Create a Heroku account. 

2. Create a new app. 

3. Give the app a unique name and select your region from the options. 

4. Connect to GitHub (you may be asked to login).

5. Select which branch you want to deploy from. 

6. Deploy the project. 

- Heroku would be more suitable for backend development which is why it's preferred over GitHub pages for this particular 
project.

# Credits 

- Code Institute for the project template and deployment terminal. 

- I used various different tutorials throughout the project.
